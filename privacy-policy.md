=== Privacy Policy ===
Last Updated: January 2025

1. Introduction
At Minguinho, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. Minguinho is owned and operated by Çınar Aktaş (Ankara, Turkey). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our self-improvement application.

2. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information:

• Personal Information: Name, email (if provided), and any information you choose to share in your profile.
• Usage Data: Workout sessions, meditation activities, journal entries, sleep patterns, and todo lists.
• Device Information: Device type, operating system, and app version for technical support.

All data is stored locally on your device unless you choose to use cloud synchronization features. We do not ingest your content on our servers.

3. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:

• Provide and maintain our services
• Track your progress and show statistics
• Personalize your experience with themes and preferences
• Send important updates and notifications (with your consent)
• Improve our application based on usage patterns

We do not sell your personal data to third parties.

4. Data Storage and Security
Your data is primarily stored locally on your device using UserDefaults. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device.

5. Third-Party Services
We use Apple's App Store for in-app purchases and subscriptions. Apple's privacy policy applies to payment processing. Aside from Apple’s billing tools, we currently do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs, which means your activity is not shared with external marketing partners.

6. Your Rights
You have the right to:

• Access your personal data
• Correct inaccurate information
• Delete your account and all associated data
• Export your data

To exercise these rights, please contact us at cinaraktas22@icloud.com or use the "Delete Profile" feature in settings.

7. Children's Privacy
Minguinho is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of Minguinho after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

9. Contact Us
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:

Email: cinaraktas22@icloud.com
Mailing Address: Çınar Aktaş, Ankara, Turkey

We will respond to your inquiry as soon as possible.

10. Data Retention & Deletion
We retain your data only for as long as you maintain your profile within Minguinho. Because all information is stored locally, deleting the app or using the "Delete Profile" option in Settings permanently removes your data. We do not keep any server-side backups, so deleted information cannot be recovered.
